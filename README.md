## 🌐 Features

### 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Create a BST by providing node elements
- Step-by-step visualization of insertion
- Understand the structure and flow of BST formation

### 🔄 Graph Traversal
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)** visualization
- **Depth First Search (DFS)** visualization
- Nodes and edges animate as the traversal proceeds

### 📊 Sorting Algorithms
Visualize and compare the behavior of:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Each sort animates the step-by-step comparisons and swaps.

### 🪟 Sliding Window Technique
- Visualize how the sliding window works on an array
- Understand dynamic window size behavior for problems like:
  - Maximum sum subarray
  - Longest substring without repeating characters


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [Optional]: React.js for component-based UI
- D3.js or plain canvas/svg for animations
